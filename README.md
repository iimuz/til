# Commit

For the commit message, follow the method of [angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits).

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a header,
a body and a footer. The header has a special format that includes a type,
a scope and a subject:

```txt
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters!
This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub
as well as in various git tools.

* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* docs: Documentation only changes
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space,
    formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* perf: A code change that improves performance
* test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
* chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools
    and libraries such as documentation generation
